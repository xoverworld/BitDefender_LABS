# Bit Defenders — game protocol (client implementer guide)

This document describes the WebSocket JSON protocol, connection lifecycle, and game rules for **Bit Defenders**, a simultaneous turn-based 1v1 sniper game.

## Transport and message shape

- Each WebSocket message is a UTF-8 JSON object with exactly two fields:
  - `command` (string): command name in `SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE`.
  - `args` (object): command-specific payload; use `{}` when no fields are required.
- Numbers are JSON numbers; coordinates are integers on a square grid.
- **Protocol version** is `1` everywhere `version` appears.

## Connection finite state machine

After a TCP/WebSocket connection opens, the server drives the following sequence:

1. **Server → `HELLO` — client must not send game commands before this.
2. **Client → `LOGIN`
3. **Server → `READY`
4. **Client → `CHALLENGE` or `**PRACTICE**`
5. Matchmaking or practice setup, then `**START_MATCH**`, repeated `**START_TURN**` until `**END_MATCH**`.

If the client sends a command that is invalid for the current phase, the server responds with `**ERROR**` and keeps or closes the connection depending on severity.

## Game rules (high level)

- **Bit Defenders** is a 1v1 match: two players; each controls **two** sniper **heroes** on a **rectangular** grid (`GameConfig.width` × `GameConfig.height`, default **51×90**).
- Turns are **simultaneous**: both players submit orders for all their heroes; the server resolves one combined tick.
- Heroes have **HP** (starting value from `config.hero_types["sniper"].max_hp`). Projectiles deal `config.hero_types["sniper"].projectile_damage`. **No friendly fire.**
- **Walls** are 3×3 blocks (by center tile), **block** movement and projectiles.
- **Reload**: after shooting, `cooldown` is set so the hero cannot shoot again until it reaches `0` (see detailed timeline). With default sniper tuning, `shoot_cooldown` and `projectile_ttl` line up so a hero typically cannot fire again while its prior shot is still in flight.
- **Vision** is a square (Chebyshev distance) around each friendly hero **center**. **Fog of war** hides enemy heroes when **no tile** of their **3×3 footprint** intersects that vision union.
- Match ends when a player has **no heroes left**, or after **`turns`** simulated ticks, or on disconnect.  
On timeout, winner tie-break is: more alive heroes, then higher total alive HP, then larger in-bounds vision coverage; if still tied, result is a tie.

## Game rules (detailed)

### Coordinates and 3×3 entities

- Tile coordinates are **0-based**: `x` in `[0, width-1]`, `y` in `[0, height-1]`.
- **Hero** and **wall** centers sit on the subgrid where `x % 3 == 1` and `y % 3 == 1` (aligned 3×3 blocks).
- A **hero** or **wall** with center `(cx, cy)` **occupies** all nine tiles `(cx+dx, cy+dy)` for `dx, dy ∈ {-1,0,1}`.
- **Projectile** position is a **single** tile `(x, y)`.

### Movement (`MOVE`)

- Each hero may move **at most one step** per turn in one of **8** directions (including diagonals). Let `(cx, cy)` be the hero center before movement and `(tx, ty)` the target from the command. If `(tx, ty)` lies inside the hero's current **3×3 footprint**, the move is a **no-op**. Otherwise compute `sx = sign(tx - cx)` and `sy = sign(ty - cy)` where each `sign` is `-1`, `0`, or `+1` (not both zero).
- The new center is `(cx + 3·sx, cy + 3·sy)` so the hero stays on valid centers (`x % 3 == 1`, `y % 3 == 1`). This is one step on the **coarse grid** of 3×3 blocks (cardinal or diagonal), not a single 1-tile shift of the center coordinates.
- If that destination center would be **out of map** or overlap any **wall** 3×3 hitbox, the move is a **no-op**.
- Heroes **do not** collide with each other (overlap allowed).

### Shooting (`SHOOT`)

- Requires `cooldown == 0`.
- Trajectory is the **integer Bresenham line** from the hero's center **after movement** this turn to the aim `(x, y)` (inclusive of endpoints in the line raster).
- **Origin** of the shot is that center (stored for reference). The projectile is left at the hero center and then advances in normal projectile resolution in the same turn.
- **Speed** per turn is `config.hero_types["sniper"].projectile_speed`. On the firing turn and on each later turn, the projectile advances up to that many Bresenham steps.
- `ttl` starts at `config.hero_types["sniper"].projectile_ttl`. At the **end** of each turn after projectile resolution, `ttl` decreases by `1`. The projectile is removed after `ttl` would go below `0` (so `0` is still a fully simulated last turn).
- **Hits** along each travel segment (firing turn segment and each later segment):
  - **Walls** and **map edge** consume the projectile with no damage.
  - The **first** enemy hero whose **3×3 hitbox** intersects the segment (in travel order) takes `projectile_damage` HP; projectile consumed.
  - Reaching the **aim tile** (last point on the Bresenham path) with no such hit also removes the projectile (no damage).
  - **Friendly** heroes and **other projectiles** do not stop shots.
- **Tie-breaking** if multiple hero hits at the same distance: lowest `hero_id`, then lowest `owner_id`.

### Cooldown timeline

- When a hero successfully fires, at end of that turn its `cooldown` is set to `config.hero_types["sniper"].shoot_cooldown` (default **4**).
- At end of each turn, every hero's `cooldown` is decreased by **1** if `cooldown > 0`, **except** heroes that fired this turn are set to the configured `shoot_cooldown` after decrement logic.

### Vision and fog (`START_TURN`)

- **Vision cells**: union of all tiles with Chebyshev distance ≤ `vision_range` (default **20**) from **each** friendly hero **center**.
- **Walls** and **Enemy heroes**: visible iff **any tile** of their **3×3 footprint** lies in the vision union
- **Projectiles**: enemy projectiles are included if their **tile** lies in the vision union.
- Your own heroes are always fully included.

### Matchmaking (`CHALLENGE`)

- **Open challenge** (no `name`): joins a pool; matches any other open challenger, or a named challenger who named you, or you can match someone who named you while you are open.
- **Named challenge** (`name: "Bob"`): matches only if Bob has challenged in a compatible way: Bob named you, or Bob is open and you named Bob (mutual), or symmetric named pair.
- **Seed compatibility**: if both players supplied `seed` in `CHALLENGE`, they are only pairable when the two seeds are equal. If one side omits `seed`, the provided seed is used.

(Exact pairing is implemented server-side; ties resolved by FIFO.)

### Disconnect

If a player disconnects during a match, the opponent wins with `reason: "disconnect"`.

### Missing or invalid orders

If a player sends no valid pair of actions for their heroes by deadline logic, missing heroes **no-op** for that turn; the server still simulates and may send `ERROR` for the bad parts.

## `GameConfig` / `GameState` shapes

See Rust `protocol/protocol.rs` for field-for-field types. Summary:

- **GameConfig**: `width`, `height`, `turns`, `vision_range`, `seed`, `players`, `hero_types`.
  - `seed`: unsigned 32-bit map seed (`0..2^32-1`).
  - **Player**: `id`, `name`, `heroes`.
  - **Player.heroes[]**: `id`, `x`, `y`, `type`.
  - `hero_types.sniper`: `shoot_cooldown`, `projectile_ttl`, `projectile_speed`, `max_hp`, `projectile_damage`.
- **GameState**: `heroes`, `projectiles`, `walls`.
- **Hero**: `id`, `owner_id`, `type` (`"sniper"`), `x`, `y`, `hp`, `cooldown`.
- **Projectile**: `owner_id`, `type` (`"sniper"`), `origin_x`, `origin_y`, `x`, `y`, `ttl`.
- **Wall**: `x`, `y` (center on the valid hero grid).
